The solution of Question 3 is:

Enter first integer value(dividend): 154
Enter second integer value(divisor): 24

Quotient: 6 
Remainder: 10

a. Check whether the function (divmod()) is callable or not:
True, which means it is callable

b. Check whether all the values are zero or not:
All values in result(i.e. quotient and remainder) are non-zero.

c. Add (4,5,6) to the result and filter out values greater than 4:
Values greater than 4(in list format) are: [5, 6, 6, 10]

d. Convert the above result into a set datatype:
The output of previous part in set datatype would be: {10, 5, 6}

e. Make the set immutable:
The immutable set would be: frozenset({10, 5, 6})

f. Evaluate the maximum value from the set and find out its hash value:
The maximum value from the set is: 10
The hash value of 10(considering it to be integer) is 10 and its hash value is -7223991491768188856(if we consider 10 as a string).

The solution of Question 4 is:
